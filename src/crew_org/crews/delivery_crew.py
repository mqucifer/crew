"""Implementation: a story becomes files, and files become a pull request.

The Developer returns a *typed set of file writes* rather than driving a
tool-use loop. That is a deliberate bet on where this model is strong: schema-
constrained output was measured at 5/5 on the substrate gate, whereas a
multi-turn edit loop compounds every tool-call mistake. One structured answer is
easier to validate, repair, and reason about than ten small ones.

Definition of Done is enforced structurally: an implementation with no test is
rejected by the schema, not noticed later by a reviewer.
