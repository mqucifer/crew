"""The retro: what the sprint actually did, and what the process should learn.

The Scrum Master reports; it does not decide. Its one job that needs judgment
is reading the escalation ledger honestly — a high escalation rate is a defect
in task design, and the retro's output is process defects, never a request for
a larger budget.
