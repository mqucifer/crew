"""Delivery: a story in the sprint becomes a pull request.

The loop is deliberately narrow. A Developer produces a typed implementation,
it is written into an isolated worktree, and the worktree is linted and tested.
If that fails, the failure is *classified* before anything else happens — which
is what keeps escalation from becoming the easy path.

Only VERIFY failures escalate, and only after local repair is exhausted. A
SCHEMA failure means the prompt or schema is wrong and gets repaired locally; a
SCOPE failure means the story was not ready and goes back to refinement.
