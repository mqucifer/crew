"""Landing approved work.

Merging used to happen only at sprint close, which was consistent with
reviewing the increment at the end — but it meant every story branched from a
`main` that was missing its predecessors. Six stories editing one module from
six different starting points produce their conflicts all at once, at the worst
possible moment.

So approval and merge timing are decoupled. The Sponsor's gate is still the
approval; this lands whatever has passed it, and runs before new work is
claimed so a branch always starts from current `main`.
