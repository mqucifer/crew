"""The reconciliation pass — one tick of the board.

A tick reads the board, decides what is actionable, and acts. It runs to
quiescence rather than one transition at a time: the Sponsor controls when the
process runs, not the hops within it.

Phase 1 is deliberately read-only. The crew proposes epics as issue comments
and moves nothing, so its decomposition can be judged before it is trusted with
the board.

This is plain reconciliation code, not a CrewAI Flow. A Flow earns its place
when routing genuinely branches by card state; for a single linear pass it
would add ceremony that obscures what is happening. It arrives with Phase 2.

    Two passes, in dependency order. It stops at Ready because that is where
    refinement ends, not because a Sponsor is waiting: section 1 of the
    constitution names exactly two human gates — epics in `Inbox (Goals)` and
    the sprint review — and admission is neither. `crew_org.flows.loop` runs the
    phase that follows.

    This used to claim sprint admission was "still the Sponsor's decision",
    which invented a third gate the constitution does not have and `crew sprint
    start` explicitly denies: "approving an epic was the scope decision, so
    this is mechanical". Work sat in Ready looking like it needed a human.
