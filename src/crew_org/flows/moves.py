"""One place where a card moves, so one place records who moved it.

Sixteen call sites wrote a card's Status directly. Seven of them emitted a
`card.moved` event and two of those named a role, so the board said a machine
had acted and the log said little more. The `**{"from": ..., "to": ...}`
kwargs those emits passed were dropped in silence — `CrewEvent` ignores extra
fields — so no move has ever recorded where it came from.

Moving through here makes the three parts inseparable: the status, the acting
role on the card, and one event that says both.
