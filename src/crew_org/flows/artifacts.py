"""Writing to GitHub, with the role that wrote it.

#22 put the acting role on the *card* — the board's `Owner Agent` field, and an
event carrying the columns. That covers movement. It does not cover what the
crew writes: a comment and a label change go straight to GitHub through
`IssueClient`, which has no notion of who is calling it, so everything the crew
said appeared as `crew[bot]` and a Sponsor reading the audit trail could not
tell refinement from review without reading the body text.

The two halves are not symmetrical, and that is worth knowing rather than
discovering. A comment has a body, so the role goes in it and can be read back.
A label change has nowhere on GitHub to record an actor — the timeline shows the
bot and nothing else — so that half can only ever land in the crew's own event
log. Both are recorded; only one is visible on GitHub.
