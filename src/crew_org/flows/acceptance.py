"""Acceptance: verifying delivered work, and closing out what is finished.

QA judges behaviour against the acceptance criteria, which is a different
question from the Reviewer's. A story only leaves QAing when every
criterion is proven by a test that actually exercises it.

The columns say what a card is waiting for, not what is happening to it. A
card sits in QAing until QA has finished with it — QA does not pull it
into a lane of its own — and lands in Merging already verified, where
what it waits for is the Sponsor.

Parent completion is bookkeeping the crew should not make a human do: an epic
whose stories are all Done is done, and so is a goal whose epics are.

# QA reasons about the test code, so what it is shown decides its verdict. A
# 12,000-character slice in the prompt cut story #13's two new tests off the end
# of a 13,839-character file, and QA correctly reported that it could not find
# them. New tests are appended, so a head-slice lands on the evidence every
# time.
#
# Past this, QA refuses to judge rather than judging on part of the evidence.
# QAVerdict has no way to say "I could not see enough to tell" — `proven` is a
# bool — so incomplete evidence has to resolve to proven or unproven, and both
# are false. Asking the model in prose not to read an omission as an absence is
# worse still: it reads equally well as "assume it is covered", which turns a
# truncation into an acceptance in the gate that now merges without a person.
# 600,000 characters is roughly 150,000 tokens. The crew's own suite is already
