"""Editing code by name rather than by position.

The Developer used to return whole files, which made every story a
transcription exercise: regenerate three hundred lines, change four, and leave
the rest byte-identical. It could not do that, and the failures were not
random — it redesigned what it was asked to extend, deleted tests, and drifted
in code nobody had asked it to touch.

Targeting by name removes the transcription entirely. The model names a
definition and supplies its new source; nothing else is reproduced, so nothing
else can be damaged. Deleting becomes an operation it has to choose rather than
an accident of regeneration.

Two findings shaped this. Aider measured a 30-50% rise in editing errors when
models were pushed toward surgical line edits instead of whole functions, and a
9x rise without permissive parsing — so edits are whole definitions and the
applier forgives imperfect input. A published comparison of edit formats found
name-addressed AST edits had zero format failures across four models, where
search/replace had eleven and unified diff thirty-one, because both of those
require reproducing existing text exactly.

Python only. The principle generalises, the parser does not.
