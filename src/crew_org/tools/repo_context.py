"""What a repository looks like, for any agent that needs to know.

Delivery was the first to need it and for a while the only one, so it lived in
the delivery flow. Refinement needs it too: a Business Analyst that cannot see
the code writes acceptance criteria against a product it is imagining. crew#6
was split into three stories addressed to "the audit trail entry", with no way
to know that the board already had an Owner Agent field sitting empty.

# is not a context budget, it is a blindfold, and every rule since #8 has been
# an attempt to describe in prose what one `cat` would have shown.

# `github_project.py` — the file defining the `Owner Agent` field the epic
# being refined was about. A guard that fires in normal work is a budget.

    """What the repository looks like, and what each file defines.

    Editing works by name, so the names are the context that matters. Listing
    them is a few hundred tokens that stay identical between attempts, where
    dumping file bodies was thousands that changed every time — which both
    poisoned the prefix cache and left the model guessing at targets it had
    never been shown. Both EDIT failures on story #8 were invented names.

    The names carry their signatures, because a name alone does not say that
    `is_completed` is a property or that `format_performance_table` takes
    `(cards, wip_limits)`. Story #9 changed both and broke thirteen tests, and
    it had never been shown either contract — it was refused for violating a
    rule nobody had told it. Signatures cost a few tokens more and are just as
    stable between attempts, so the cacheable prefix is unaffected.

    The bodies follow, in full, on every attempt. They used to appear only on a
    repair, on a prefix-cache argument: bodies churn between attempts where
    names do not. That optimised the wrong thing. Story #11 rewrote `main` —
    dropped its return type, its docstring and its stdin default — and was
    refused for breaking a contract that lives in a body it had never been
    shown. The signature line it did get, `main(argv: Sequence[str] | None =
    None) -> int`, carries none of that. Cache hits are cheaper than a story
    that never lands.

    `editing=False` leaves out the rules about how to address a definition and
    what may not be reshaped. Refinement reads this to decide what work should
    exist; it is not editing anything, and instructions for a job it is not
    doing are noise competing with the ones it must follow.
