"""Escalation to headless Claude Code.

This is the crew's only path to a stronger model, and it runs on the Sponsor's
existing subscription rather than a metered API key. That is the whole point:
hitting a usage limit stops work, it never produces a bill. A rate limit is
therefore an ordinary outcome to be parked and retried, not an error.

Escalation is rationed by crew_org.escalation. Nothing here decides whether to
escalate — only how.
