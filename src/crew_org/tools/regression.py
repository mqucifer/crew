"""Detecting when an implementation destroys work that already exists.

The Developer returns whole files, which is what makes its output easy to
validate and repair. The cost is that touching an existing file means rewriting
it, and a model asked to "add throughput" will happily redesign the module it
is adding to — discarding functions that other stories, and other tests, depend
on.

Observed on story #7: it rewrote story #6's merged module from scratch, renamed
its public functions, and implemented three future stories along the way. The
existing tests then failed to import, which reads as a coding error rather than
as the regression it is.

This is checked mechanically because it is mechanically checkable, and because
a prompt asking the model not to do it is a request rather than a guarantee.

# --- what a replacement may not change -----------------------------------
#
# Editing by name made the change list visible, but nothing evaluated whether
# the listed scope was proportionate to the story. Six public definitions were
# replaced for a card that asked for one column, and every replacement changed
# a signature: a frozen dataclass gained fields, properties became methods, a
# return type went from `int` to `float | None`. The private helper that
# consumed those values was never looked at, so it went on summing integers
# over a list of None.
#
# Hence the line drawn here. A body is the author's business. A signature is a
# promise other code is already relying on, and a story that says "add a
# column" is not a story about renegotiating promises.
