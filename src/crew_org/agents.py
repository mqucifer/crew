"""Construction of CrewAI agents from configuration.

Roles are data, not code: agents.yaml holds the role, goal, backstory, the
LiteLLM alias, the capability allow-list, and the constitution sections the role
is bound by. Changing how a role behaves is a config change reviewed like any
other, rather than a prompt edited in passing.
