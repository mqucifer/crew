"""Capability allow-lists per role.

Some role boundaries depend on granularity (goal vs epic vs story) or on
altitude (what vs how). Those are precisely the distinctions a small model
blurs, and prompt wording does not hold them reliably. Making them structural
means a Product Owner cannot write acceptance criteria even if it decides it
should, and a Business Analyst cannot redraw an epic boundary it disagrees with.
