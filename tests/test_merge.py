"""Landing approved work.

Merging only at sprint close meant every story branched from a main missing its
predecessors — six stories editing one module from six different starting
points, producing their conflicts all at once. Approval and merge timing are
therefore decoupled: the Sponsor's gate is the approval, and this lands what has
passed it before new work is claimed.
